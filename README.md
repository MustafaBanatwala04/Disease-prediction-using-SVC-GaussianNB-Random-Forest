# Disease Prediction Machine Learning Model

Welcome to the Disease Prediction Machine Learning project! This project aims to predict diseases based on user-entered symptoms using three different machine learning models. Currently, the model can predict up to 40 different diseases with high accuracy.

## Overview

1. **Objective:** Predict diseases based on user-entered symptoms.
2. **Number of Diseases:** Up to 40 different diseases can be predicted.
3. **Machine Learning Models:**
    - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
    - Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
    - Random Forest

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning).

## Model Performance Metrics

All three machine learning models (SVC, GaussianNB, Random Forest) have achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 100%
- **Precision:** 100%
- **Recall:** 100%
- **F1 Score:** 100%

## Note

This project is currently in the modeling stage, and the implementation of a user interface is still pending. The primary focus has been on developing and fine-tuning the machine learning models for accurate disease prediction.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or stay tuned for updates as we work towards enhancing the project with a user-friendly interface.
