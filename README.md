# Disease-prediction-using-SVC-GaussianNB-Random-Forest
Predict diseases with precision using this Disease Prediction Machine Learning Model. This project employs three powerful machine learning models—Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), and Random Forest—to accurately predict up to 40 different diseases based on user-entered symptoms.
